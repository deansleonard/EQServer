  <p style="margin: 3px 0px 15px; font-size: 0.8em;">For those of you
that choose to use the GNU General Public License, my interpretation of
the GNU General Public License is that no Perl script falls under the
terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put said script under the terms
of the GPL yourself.</p>
  <p style="margin: 3px 0px 15px; font-size: 0.8em;">Furthermore, any
object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions of
subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the resulting
interpreter from executing any standard Perl script. I consider linking
in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral equivalent of defining
subroutines in the Perl language itself. You may sell such an object
file as proprietary provided that you provide or offer to provide the
Perl source, as specified by the GNU General Public License. (This is
merely an alternate way of specifying input to the program.) You may
also sell a binary produced by the dumping of a running Perl script
that belongs to you, provided that you provide or offer to provide the
Perl source as specified by the GPL. (The fact that a Perl interpreter
and your code are in the same binary file is, in this case, a form of
mere aggregation.)</p>
  <p style="margin: 3px 0px 15px; font-size: 0.8em;">This is my
interpretation of the GPL. If you still have concerns or difficulties
understanding my intent, feel free to contact me. Of course, the
Artistic License spells all this out for your protection, so you may
prefer to use that.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND
DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Definitions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "License" shall mean the terms and
conditions for use, reproduction,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and distribution as defined by Sections
1 through 9 of this document.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Licensor" shall mean the copyright
owner or entity authorized by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the copyright owner that is granting the
License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of
the acting entity and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other entities that control, are
controlled by, or are under common<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; control with that entity. For the
purposes of this definition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "control" means (i) the power, direct or
indirect, to cause the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; direction or management of such entity,
whether by contract or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty
percent (50%) or more of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
ownership of such entity.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You" (or "Your") shall mean an
individual or Legal Entity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exercising permissions granted by this
License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Source" form shall mean the preferred
form for making modifications,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including but not limited to software
source code, documentation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; source, and configuration files.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Object" form shall mean any form
resulting from mechanical<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transformation or translation of a
Source form, including but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not limited to compiled object code,
generated documentation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and conversions to other media types.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Work" shall mean the work of
authorship, whether in Source or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Object form, made available under the
License, as indicated by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copyright notice that is included in or
attached to the work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (an example is provided in the Appendix
below).<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Derivative Works" shall mean any work,
whether in Source or Object<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; form, that is based on (or derived from)
the Work and for which the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; editorial revisions, annotations,
elaborations, or other modifications<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; represent, as a whole, an original work
of authorship. For the purposes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of this License, Derivative Works shall
not include works that remain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; separable from, or merely link (or bind
by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Contribution" shall mean any work of
authorship, including<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the original version of the Work and any
modifications or additions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to that Work or Derivative Works
thereof, that is intentionally<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; submitted to Licensor for inclusion in
the Work by the copyright owner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or by an individual or Legal Entity
authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the copyright owner. For the purposes of
this definition, "submitted"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; means any form of electronic, verbal, or
written communication sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Licensor or its representatives,
including but not limited to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; communication on electronic mailing
lists, source code control systems,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and issue tracking systems that are
managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licensor for the purpose of discussing
and improving the Work, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excluding communication that is
conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; designated in writing by the copyright
owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and
any individual or Legal Entity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on behalf of whom a Contribution has
been received by Licensor and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subsequently incorporated within the
Work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and
conditions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copyright license to reproduce, prepare
Derivative Works of,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work and such Derivative Works in Source
or Object form.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and
conditions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this License, each Contributor hereby
grants to You a perpetual,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (except as stated in this section)
patent license to make, have made,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where such license applies only to those
patent claims licensable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by such Contributor that are necessarily
infringed by their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Work to which such
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; institute patent litigation against any
entity (including a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or a Contribution incorporated within
the Work constitutes direct<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or contributory patent infringement,
then any patent licenses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; granted to You under this License for
that Work shall terminate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies
of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work or Derivative Works thereof in any
medium, with or without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modifications, and in Source or Object
form, provided that You<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; meet the following conditions:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) You must give any other recipients
of the Work or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Derivative Works
a copy of this License; and<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) You must cause any modified files to
carry prominent notices<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stating that You
changed the files; and<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) You must retain, in the Source form
of any Derivative Works<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that You
distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attribution
notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; excluding those
notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Derivative
Works; and<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text
file as part of its<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; distribution,
then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include a
readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within such
NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pertain to any
part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the following
places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; documentation,
if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within a display
generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wherever such
third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the NOTICE
file are for informational purposes only and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do not modify
the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notices within
Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or as an
addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that such
additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as modifying the
License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may add Your own copyright statement
to Your modifications and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may provide additional or different
license terms and conditions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for use, reproduction, or distribution
of Your modifications, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for any such Derivative Works as a
whole, provided Your use,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reproduction, and distribution of the
Work otherwise complies with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the conditions stated in this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
state otherwise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by You to the Licensor shall be under
the terms and conditions of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this License, without any additional
terms or conditions.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the above, nothing
herein shall supersede or modify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the terms of any separate license
agreement you may have executed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with Licensor regarding such
Contributions.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to
use the trade<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; names, trademarks, service marks, or
product names of the Licensor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; except as required for reasonable and
customary use in describing the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; origin of the Work and reproducing the
content of the NOTICE file.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
law or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
the Work (and each<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributor provides its Contributions)
on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
KIND, either express or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; implied, including, without limitation,
any warranties or conditions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
responsible for determining the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appropriateness of using or
redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; risks associated with Your exercise of
permissions under this License.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal
theory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whether in tort (including negligence),
contract, or otherwise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unless required by applicable law (such
as deliberate and grossly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall any Contributor be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incidental, or consequential damages of
any character arising as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result of this License or out of the use
or inability to use the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other commercial damages or losses),
even if such Contributor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has been advised of the possibility of
such damages.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
redistributing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
You may choose to offer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and charge a fee for, acceptance of
support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; License. However, in accepting such
obligations, You may act only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on Your own behalf and on Your sole
responsibility, not on behalf<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of any other Contributor, and only if
You agree to indemnify,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defend, and hold each Contributor
harmless for any liability<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of your accepting any such warranty or
additional liability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To apply the Apache License to your
work, attach the following<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; boilerplate notice, with the fields
enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; replaced with your own identifying
